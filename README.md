A lightest-weight example of an Angular2 TypeScript application with:

  * TypeScript compilation
  * Beta 0 support
  * Http and the observable API
  * HTML rendering

## To set up

```javascript
npm install -g live-server
npm install -g typescript@1.7.3
cd projectdir
npm install
live-server
tsc (should find the typescript tsconfig.json file)
```

You may also open this in WebStorm or any other tool that provides a
typescript compiler and let 'er rip.

Best,

Ken
